====
This repo was made for purpose of helping mates that having issues downloading the files from the telegram group,
and special thanks to everyone, whom supported me in this small but useful project; so as it can stay as long as possible.<br/>
The main idea depends on speed and performance because they are necessary critical. by using `JSON` files as map, so as modifying becomes easy, it's loaded and parsed with `JavaScript` inside the browser.<br/>
take a look at [`configuring.md`](https://github.com/eliasfaisal/FilesRepo/blob/main/configuring.md) at [ProtoType Branch](https://github.com/eliasfaisal/FilesRepo/tree/prototype), for implemenation.
